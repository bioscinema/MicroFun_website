# Concordance measurement

In the CoMPASS paper, we developed different concordance index to measure the concordance for real data. The CoMPASS R package provide not only single level concordance calculation but also dor overall.

```{r eval=FALSE}
result <- concordance_overall(phy)
result1 <- concordance_split(phy1,phy2)
```

# Power Calculation

The `powerCalculation()` function in the CoMPASS R package offers three built-in simulation presets—`gut`, `oral`, and `infant`—and lets you specify your sequencing platform via the `platform` argument: `"amp"` for 16S rRNA amplicon data or `"wgs"` for whole-genome shotgun data.


```{r eval=FALSE}
# Example: Evaluate power for gut data using amplicon sequencing ("amp")
# with 50 simulation replicates, a significance level of 0.05,
# 100 samples per simulation, and 200 OTUs simulated with 10% differential abundance.
result <- powerCalculation(
  data.type = "gut",     # Choose data type: "gut", "oral", or "infant"
  method = "amp",        # Choose sequencing method: "amp" (16S) or "wgs" (WGS)
  nSim = 50,             # Number of simulation replicates
  alpha = 0.05,          # Significance level
  nSam = 100,            # Number of samples per simulation replicate
  nOTU = 200,            # Number of OTUs to simulate
  diff.otu.pct = 0.1      # Proportion of OTUs that are differentially abundant
  # All other parameters will use their default values.
)

# Print the overall estimated power (proportion of replicates with significant results)
print(result$overall_power)

# Optionally, print the detection indicator for each replicate
print(result$replicate_power)
```

# Sample Size Calculation

The `sampleCalculationRange()` function produces a line plot of statistical power across a user-specified range of sample sizes. You can control:

- `lower_bound` & `upper_bound`: the range of desired sample size  
- `type`: the data type (`gut`, `oral`, and `infant`)  
- `platform`: the sequencing platform (`"amp"` for 16S rRNA amplicon, `"wgs"` for shotgun)  
- `nOTU`: the number of OTUs to include in the simulation  

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Evaluate power for sample sizes from 50 to 200 (in increments of 5)
# for gut data using the 16S (amplicon) method.
result <- sampleCalculationRange(
  lower_bound = 50,
  upper_bound = 200,
  data.type = "gut",
  method = "amp",
  nSim = 100,       # Number of simulation replicates
  nOTU = 300,       # Number of OTUs to simulate
  diff.otu.pct = 0.1  # Proportion of OTUs that are differentially abundant
)

# Display the results:
print(result$data)
print(result$plot)

```

# Price Calculation

Budget considerations are critical: the `priceCalculation()` function estimates the total project cost across a user‐specified range of sample sizes to achieve a desired statistical power.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Minimal example call to priceCalculation:
price_estimates <- priceCalculation(
  target_power = 0.8,       # Desired power (80%)
  lower_bound = 50,         # Minimum sample size to consider
  upper_bound = 200,        # Maximum sample size to consider
  data.type = "gut",        # Data type ("gut", "oral", or "infant")
  nOTU=300
)

# Print the resulting data frame
print(price_estimates)
```
